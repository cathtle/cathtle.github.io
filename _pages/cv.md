Internship Experience
Qingdao Tianren Micro‑Nano Technology Co., Ltd. — Intern

Fabricated spherical microlens‑array masters via thermal reflow, then tuned and verified the optical parameters of the lenses.

Assisted in building an interference‑lithography optical setup and helped optimise and validate the exposure process.

Produced nano‑imprint masters using ICP etching, and further refined and validated the Cr‑film surface imprint process.

Jiangsu Leuven Instruments Co., Ltd. — Intern

Optimised Cr/Mo hard‑mask etching parameters and developed a wafer‑level tilted‑TiO₂ etching process, delivering multiple customer demos in an engineering role.

Participated in equipment stability testing to ensure long‑term tool reliability and process repeatability.


Strong communication and collaboration skills, with over one year of experience in cross-departmental and cross-company project coordination; highly effective team player with strong execution capabilities.

Familiar with key equipment across the semiconductor fabrication process, including interference lithography, nanoimprint lithography, etching, and deposition. In-depth understanding of process technologies for materials such as SiC, Si, and SiO₂. Proficient in the design and fabrication of various surface-relief gratings, including methods for process optimisation. Experienced in grayscale laser direct writing.

Skilled in the design of diffractive optical waveguides, including both one-dimensional and two-dimensional pupil expansion schemes. Familiar with non-e-beam-based fabrication techniques for diffractive waveguide masters, with strong integrated technical capabilities.
